# Developer logins

One-click sign-in buttons under the login form, for the accounts you seed in development. Pick a user, land in the panel — no password typing while you build.

## Enabling

Developer logins are **off** by default. Turn them on per panel and say which users appear:

```php
use Packstub\AccountSwitcher\AccountSwitcherPlugin;

AccountSwitcherPlugin::make()
    // e-mails of seeded users
    ->developerLogins(['admin@example.com', 'editor@example.com', 'customer@example.com'])
```

Other forms:

```php
// a closure returning the users (any iterable of Authenticatable)
->developerLogins(fn () => User::query()->whereIn('role', ['admin', 'editor'])->get())

// the first ten users by id
->developerLogins(true)

// off
->developerLogins(false)
```

## How it's gated

Two independent checks must pass before a button renders or a login is accepted:

1. **Environment** — `config('packstub-account-switcher.developer_logins.environments')`, `['local']` by default. This is a hard ceiling: no panel setting can make the buttons appear in an environment that isn't listed.
2. **Plugin** — `->developerLogins()` must be enabled on the panel, and the user must be in the resolved list.

The login itself is a CSRF-protected `POST` to `filament.{panel}.account-switcher.developer-login`, throttled to 10 requests per minute. The controller re-runs both checks and returns 404 when either fails, so a stray button or a crafted request never signs anyone in.

```php
// config/packstub-account-switcher.php
'developer_logins' => [
    'environments' => ['local', 'testing'],
],
```

## What happens on click

The panel guard is re-authenticated as the chosen user, the session is regenerated, an [audit row](configuration.md#the-switch-log) with reason `SwitchReason::DeveloperLogin` is written, and the browser is redirected to a panel the user may access.

## Customizing the buttons

Publish the views and edit `resources/views/vendor/packstub-account-switcher/developer-logins.blade.php`:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="packstub-account-switcher-views"
```

The view receives `$users` (a collection) and renders one form per user using Filament's `<x-filament::button>`.
