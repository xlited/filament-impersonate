## What you get

| Feature | What it means for you |
| --- | --- |
| **Linked accounts** | Do daily work from a low-privilege account and switch to your full admin account only when you need it. A "Switch to" menu in the topbar lists the accounts you've linked. Switching *up* asks for that account's password; switching *down* is one click. |
| **Impersonation** | `ImpersonateAction` for your user resource, a persistent banner with "Switch back", and `canImpersonate()` / `canBeImpersonated()` hooks on your model. |
| **Developer logins** | One-click sign-in buttons on the login page for the accounts you seed locally — never rendered outside the environments you allow. |
| **Audit trail** | Every switch is recorded with who, to whom, why, panel, IP and user agent, and fires `AccountSwitching` / `AccountSwitched` events. |
