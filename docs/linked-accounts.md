# Linked accounts

Linked accounts let one person hold several accounts and move between them without signing out. The typical setup is a **full admin account** you rarely touch and a **daily account** with fewer permissions — the plugin makes the safe account the convenient one.

## The "Switch to" menu

Once you have at least one linked account, a **Switch to** button appears next to the user menu. It lists every linked account with its label (or name) and e-mail, plus a link to the Linked accounts page.

Choosing an account either switches immediately or opens a small modal asking for **that account's password**, depending on the link's *Ask for password when switching* setting.

The menu is hidden while impersonating — see [Security](security.md#no-escalation-through-impersonation).

To move it elsewhere, pass any `PanelsRenderHook` constant:

```php
use Filament\View\PanelsRenderHook;

AccountSwitcherPlugin::make()
    ->switcherRenderHook(PanelsRenderHook::USER_MENU_PROFILE_BEFORE)
```

## The Linked accounts page

![The Linked accounts page with two linked accounts and the Link / Create actions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/packstub/filament-account-switcher/main/docs/images/linked-accounts-page.png)

Reachable from the user menu (**Linked accounts**) or at `/{panel}/linked-accounts`. It lists the accounts linked to the one you're signed in with, and offers:

| Action | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Create sub-account** | Creates a new user (name, e-mail, password) and links it to you. The new account is created through your user model, or through `createSubAccountUsing()` if you need to set roles or extra columns. |
| **Link existing account** | Links an account you already own. You must enter that account's e-mail **and password** — proving you control it. |
| **Rename** | The label shown in the menu (for example "Daily" or "Super admin"). |
| **Ask for password when switching** | Toggle per link. See [the password rule](#the-password-rule). |
| **Unlink** | Removes the link in both directions. |

The page is unavailable while impersonating.

### Creating sub-accounts with roles

By default a sub-account is `User::create(['name', 'email', 'password'])`. Hook in to assign roles, copy attributes, or send a welcome e-mail:

```php
AccountSwitcherPlugin::make()
    ->createSubAccountUsing(function (array $data, User $owner): User {
        $account = User::create([
            ...$data,
            'team_id' => $owner->team_id,
        ]);

        $account->assignRole('editor');

        return $account;
    })
```

`$data` contains `name`, `email` and an already-hashed `password`.

### Hiding the user menu item

By default the plugin adds a **Linked accounts** item to the user menu:

![The Linked accounts item in the user menu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/packstub/filament-account-switcher/main/docs/images/user-menu.png)

```php
AccountSwitcherPlugin::make()
    ->linkedAccounts(userMenuItem: false)
```

The page remains registered so you can link to it from elsewhere (`LinkedAccounts::getUrl()`).

### Replacing the page

Extend `Packstub\AccountSwitcher\Filament\Pages\LinkedAccounts`, override what you need, and register your class:

```php
AccountSwitcherPlugin::make()
    ->linkedAccountsPage(App\Filament\Pages\MyLinkedAccounts::class)
```

## The password rule

Each direction of a link has its own *requires password* flag:

- When **you** create the link (from account A to account B), you choose whether switching A → B asks for B's password.
- The reverse direction (B → A) **always requires A's password** until someone signed in as B relaxes it from B's Linked accounts page.

In practice: create your daily sub-account from the admin account with the toggle off, and you get one-click *down*, password-protected *up*. The password asked for is always the **target** account's — a compromised low-privilege session cannot reach the admin account without the admin password.

## Programmatic API

The trait on your user model:

```php
$admin->linkAccount($daily, label: 'Daily', requiresPassword: false);
$admin->unlinkAccount($daily);
$admin->isLinkedTo($daily);          // bool
$admin->linkedAccounts;              // BelongsToMany, pivot has label + requires_password
```

The `AccountSwitcher` facade:

```php
use Packstub\AccountSwitcher\Facades\AccountSwitcher;

AccountSwitcher::canSwitchToLinkedAccount($from, $to);   // bool
AccountSwitcher::requiresPassword($from, $to);           // bool
AccountSwitcher::switchToLinkedAccount($to, $password);  // throws AccountSwitchDenied
AccountSwitcher::redirectUrlFor($to);                    // where to send the browser next
```

`switchToLinkedAccount()` re-authenticates the panel guard as the target, regenerates the session, writes an [audit row](configuration.md#the-switch-log), and dispatches `AccountSwitching` then `AccountSwitched` with reason `SwitchReason::LinkedAccount`.

## Adding your own rule

Deny a switch for reasons of your own — a locked account, a required 2FA, a tenant boundary:

```php
AccountSwitcherPlugin::make()
    ->canSwitchUsing(fn (User $from, User $to): bool => ! $to->is_locked && $to->two_factor_confirmed_at !== null)
```

The callback runs after the built-in checks (linked, not impersonating, target may access a panel).
